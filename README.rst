What is ClimDown?
=================

"ClimDown" is a Climate Downscaling package for the `R statistical
programming language`. It was written at the `Pacific Climate Impacts
Consortium`_ (PCIC) with support from `Environment Canada`_.

The package provides routines for downscaling coarse scale global
climate model (GCM) output to a fine spatial resolution.

PCIC's suite of routines include several different (yet related)
downscaling techniques:

* Bias-Corrected Spatial Downscaling (BCSD)
* Bias-Correction Constructed Analogues (BCCA)
* Bias Correction/Climate Imprint (BCCI)
* Bias Correction/Constructed Analogues with Quantile mapping reordering (BCCAQ).

See the corresponding scientific literature for more details on the
pros and cons of each downscaling method.
