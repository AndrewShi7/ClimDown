\title{High-level NetCDF I/O wrapper for the Bias Correction Constructed Analogues (BCCA) pipeline}
\usage{
bcca.netcdf.wrapper(gcm.file, obs.file, varname = "tasmax")
}
\arguments{
\item{gcm.file}{Filename of GCM simulations}

\item{obs.file}{Filename of high-res gridded historical observations}

\item{varname}{Name of the NetCDF variable to downscale (e.g. 'tasmax')}
}
\value{
A list object with two values: 'indices' and 'weights', each of which is a vector with 30 items
}
\description{
BCCA starts by spatially aggregating high-resolution
gridded observations up to the scale of a GCM. Then it proceeds to
bias correcting the GCM based on those observations. Finally, it
conducts the search for temporal analogues (which is the most
expensive part of the operation). This involves taking each
timestep in the GCM and searching for the top 30 closest timesteps
(for some function of "close") in the gridded observations. For
each of the 30 closest "analogue" timesteps, BCCA records the
integer number of the timestep and a weight for each of the
analogues. These are all saved in output.file.
