#' ClimDown: PCIC's daily Climate Downscaling library
#'
#' This package includes PCIC's routines and techniques for
#' downscaling coarse scale Global Climate Models (GCMs) to fine scale
#' spatial resolution.
#'
#' At present, the package only exports high-level wrapper function
#' that perform each of three downscaling steps: BCCI, BCCA, and
#' QPQM. Each wrapper simply takes four arguments: GCM file, gridded
#' observation file, output file, and variable name.
#'
#' The package also provides three wrapper scripts that allow the user
#' to run each step from the command line with Rscript.
